## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
embedding_matrix = tf.Variable(tf.random_uniform([n, m], -1.0, 1.0))
embedding_output = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(embedding_matrix,
x_data_placeholder)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are a data scientist or a machine learning engineer with some knowledge of linear algebra, statistics, and machine learning, this book is for you. If you want to skip the theory and build production-ready machine learning models using Tensorflow without reading pages and pages of material, this book is for you. Some background in Python programming is assumed.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).
